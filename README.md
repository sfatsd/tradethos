# Tradethos 📈

**Tradethos** is a portable, modular trading & investment skill package designed for AI agent platforms (such as OpenClaw, Antigravity, and MCP-compatible agent environments). It empowers AI agents to research equities, build and track custom stock baskets (user-defined indices), monitor performance, and safely execute brokerage operations via the Robinhood Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Personal Stock Baskets**: Create and track thematic stock indices (e.g., *AI Infrastructure*, *Storage & Memory*, *Optical & Photonics*) with custom target allocations.
- **Transaction & Position Tracking**: Track actual positions, share counts, average cost basis, realized/unrealized P&L, and daily/total changes.
- **Safety-First Trade Execution**: Mandatory review-before-place safety rails for all brokerage operations, ensuring user confirmation prior to order placement.
- **Deep Market & Fundamental Research**: Full suite of fundamental analysis, financial statement trends, technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages), and earnings history.
- **Stock Screening**: Build and execute live market scanners using Robinhood's Beacon screening engine.
- **Privacy-First Local Storage**: All personal portfolio data and transaction histories are saved locally under `data/baskets/` and kept out of version control (`.gitignore`).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- An AI Agent platform supporting Agent Skills (`SKILL.md` format, e.g., OpenClaw, Antigravity).
- Robinhood MCP server installed and configured in your environment.

### 2. Installation
Clone this repository into your project directory or link `.agents/` to your agent workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sfatsd/tradethos.git
```

### 3. Usage Examples

Simply interact with your AI agent naturally:

- **Create a Basket**: *"Create a basket called Storage Leaders with WDC at 30%, STX at 30%, and MU at 40%"*
- **Research a Stock**: *"Research NVDA for me and check its 14-day RSI and recent quarterly revenue growth"*
- **Screen for Opportunities**: *"Screen for stocks with RSI below 30 and market cap over $10B"*
- **Check Basket Performance**: *"How is my Storage Leaders basket performing today?"*
- **Execute & Log a Trade**: *"Buy 5 shares of WDC and record the transaction in my Storage Leaders basket"*

## 🛡️ Safety & Guardrails

- **Explicit User Confirmation**: All order execution (`place_equity_order`), cancellations, and watchlist modifications require explicit user approval.
- **Simulated Order Reviews**: Orders are automatically run through `review_equity_order` to display estimated cost, purchasing power, and warnings before placement.
- **Idempotency**: Orders generate unique client UUIDs (`ref_id`) to prevent accidental duplicate orders on transport retries.
